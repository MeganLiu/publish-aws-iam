##Resource lock in Azure using Terraform
###Put a lock on an Azure resource using Terraform is really easy.
##Configure a CanNotDelete lock can be done like this :

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "resource-group" {
  name     = "my-resource-group"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_public_ip" "public-ip" {
  name                    = "locked-publicip"
  location                = azurerm_resource_group.resource-group.location
  resource_group_name     = azurerm_resource_group.resource-group.name
  allocation_method       = "Static"
}

resource "azurerm_management_lock" "lock-public-ip" {
  name       = "lock-public-ip"
  scope      = azurerm_public_ip.public-ip.id
  lock_level = "CanNotDelete"
  notes      = "Lock managed by Terraform"
}
###Configure a ReadOnly lock is exactly the same :

resource "azurerm_management_lock" "lock-public-ip" {
  name       = "lock-public-ip"
  scope      = azurerm_public_ip.public-ip.id
  lock_level = "ReadOnly"
  notes      = "Lock managed by Terraform"
